I can feel I'm one
With the tortured land
With its solitude and decay
There is no one left
All the other men
Pass on through the night

All dead and gone
Still i don't dare to move
The imprisoned soul
Cannot find back home

Snow falls down
It covers field and blood
Snow falls down
And clears the view

And once again
The battle's fought
Out on the plains
So rhymes spread out
It's glory
But no rhymes define its pain

I can't recall all their names
Connection broke loose
They've crossed the lake
Reach the other side
And leave me alone
With the truth

All the king's horses
And all the king's men
They've failed to damn the flood and
They've failed to find the grail
Talisien, old friend of mine
Sing my song

Then once again
The battle's lost
I am to blame

Snow falls down
All dead and gone
They all are dead and gone
They've turned to dust
They've sealed the past
A long long time ago

I can't recall all their names
Connection broke loose
They've crossed the lake
Reach the other side
And leave me alone

I can't recall all their names
Connection broke loose
They've crossed the lake
Reach the other side
And leave me alone
With the truth
